This project is implemented with the help machine learning algorithms such as SVM, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and KNN to predict diseases like Parkinson's, diabetes, and heart disorders with an accuracy ranging between 80-85%. A user-friendly interface is created using Streamlit for easy interaction and deployment.
